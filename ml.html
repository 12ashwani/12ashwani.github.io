            <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
            <p>
                Dive into my machine learning projects, where I've applied advanced data science techniques to 
                solve real-world challenges across various domains. From assessing loan repayment capabilities in 
                the banking sector to categorizing products for e-commerce platforms and detecting fraudulent credit card transactions, 
                each project demonstrates my ability to preprocess data, select and fine-tune models, and deploy solutions using 
                cutting-edge tools like TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and Streamlit. These projects not only showcase my technical skills but also
                highlight my commitment to creating practical, data-driven solutions that address complex business needs.
